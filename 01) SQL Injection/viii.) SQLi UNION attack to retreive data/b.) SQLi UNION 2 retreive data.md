## ⛳ Lab: SQL injection UNION attack, retrieving data from other tables


-  This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results
   from the query are returned in the application's response, so you can use a UNION attack to
   retrieve data from other tables. To construct such an attack, you need to combine some of the
   techniques you learned in previous labs.

-  The database contains a different table called  `dob`users, with columns called  `username`       and `password`.

-  To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection UNION attack that retrieves all usernames and
   passwords, and use the information to log in as the  `administrator` user.


   🍁 `Solution:`
   -

1) Use Burp Suite or Search bar to modify the request that sets the product category filter.

2) Determine the number of columns that are being returned by the query and which columns
   contain text data. Verify that the query is returning two columns, both of which contain
   text, using a payload like the following in the category parameter:

       '+UNION+SELECT+'abc','def'--

3) Use the following payload to retrieve the contents of the users table:

       '+UNION+SELECT+username,+password+FROM+users--
   
4) Verify that the application's response contains usernames and passwords.
