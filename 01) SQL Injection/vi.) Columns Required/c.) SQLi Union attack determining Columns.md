## ⛳ Lab: SQL injection UNION attack, determining the number of columns returned by the query

 - This lab contains a SQLi vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are 
   returned in the application's response, so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables. The 
   first step of such an attack is to determine the number of columns that are being returned by the query. You 
   will then use this technique in subsequent labs to construct the full attack.

- To solve the lab, determine the number of columns returned by the query by performing a SQLi UNION 
  attack that returns an additional row containing null values. 


🍁 `Solution`
-

   - Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request that sets the product category filter or from the search  bar modify the category query.
   - Modify the category parameter, giving it the value `'+UNION+SELECT+NULL--`. Observe that an error occurs.
   - Modify the category parameter to add an additional column containing a null value:
    `'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL--`
   - Continue adding null values until the error disappears and the response includes additional content containing the null values.
